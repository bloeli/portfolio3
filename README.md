After being invited to a lunch with the #addher community, I was inspired to code again.
I've been thinking about my coding skills and curiosity to learn more since I studied at the Front End Boot Camp at Technigo in Fall 2023.

In 2019, I changed my career from career counseling to becoming an optician's assistant. I got my first job at an optrician store in the spring of 2020 and then the pandemic started... I was told that if there would be fewer customers due to the pandemic I may lose my job though I was the newest on the job. I got a bit paniced and thought about applying for the Front End Boot Camp, and so I did.

I didn't lose my job as an optician's assistant, and while I was working full time I studied this Boot Camp as well. I loved my job as an optician's assistant - especially because of my wonderful colleagues and manager. It felt safe to have a job that I really liked, especially when the pandemic was at the beginning. So it felt a little scary to give up this job and maybe not end up with any job as a junior frontend developer in pandemic times. I also got to use some of my frontend skills when I was given responsibility for the web in the store.

After a few years I met "my person", fell in love and we lived some hours apart. I have been alerted to a job closer to where my love lives and works - and the job would make me learn more about optics - it felt like a good and exciting opportunity. So I applied and got the job.

However I would like to work as a developer and this summer I meet a person who works in the field. She inspired me and made me feel less insecure about my skills and capabilities #imposter syndrome.
So now I'm updating my skills and my portfolio and taking the step into the universe to develop again :)
